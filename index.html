Yet I feel that the public needs to be protected from bad psychiatrists practicing in the province, even if it means sacrificing myself.</p><p id="155a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">So I feel it is important, as a matter of public interest, to inform the public and medical trainees about the types of things that happened to me while training at Dalhousie University, an experience full of <a class="ag no" href="https://kevinmd.com/2025/06/the-hidden-war-on-doctors-understanding-administrative-violence.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><strong class="mr hc">physician-on-physician administrative violence</strong></a>. I also wish to especially warn any medical trainees who have a vulnerable background — anyone with any kind of disability or trauma history — that my interpretation of my experiences is that anything Dalhousie University says about supporting EDIA is merely performative. I firmly believe that I would have been better off going unmatched in CaRMS over going to Dalhousie University for training, because the ableism and other human rights violations are severe enough that I filed a human rights complaint against the institution.<p>This human rights complaint was heading toward private resolution in the summer of 2024, and I was very open to reconciliation if Dalhousie could have expressed remorse, taken accountability, and taken adequate actions to undo the harm caused to me. Sadly, the institution lacks that kind of integrity, and a restorative resolution is apparently not possible. Instead, I will share my truth, while I wait for the remedies I have requested to restore the life that Dalhousie derailed. The problematic institution was under investigation by the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission, and as of November 20, 2025, the NSHRC's Human Rights Commissioners convened and recommended this case be heard at a Board of Inquiry. In other words, <b>the actions of Dalhousie's Psychiatry Training Program will be heard in public human rights court, and all evidence will become available to the public in due time</b>. Despite the university's significant efforts to have the case dismissed, including dirty tactics that are shameful behavior from a taxpayer-funded institution, I am fortunate enough to have one of Canada's best human rights lawyers representing me. <a href="https://marshalllaw.ca/team_members/kathrynmarshall/">Kathryn Marshall and her team</a> made excellent arguments that persuaded the NSHRC to allow my <i>full</i> story to be heard in court, with my identity protected.</p><p id="cafc" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">When I first moved to Nova Scotia for my psychiatry residency, I had contemplated staying, working full-time as a psychiatrist for Dalhousie and Nova Scotia Health, and building a new life there. Within the year, I realized that moving to Nova Scotia was the biggest mistake of my life.</p><p id="3cc7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">“The nicest people in Canada” was the claim I was told. “We’re like a family” they claimed during my residency interview process. I quickly learned that “nice” is largely superficial, and by “family” they surely must have meant a dysfunctional one. Beneath the performance of niceties lurks an abundance of astonishing behaviours.</p><p id="ca59" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">Consider the workplace bullying faced by <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/11/E250" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Dr. Gabrielle Horne</a>. She was bullied by older male colleagues, the system did not address the bullying appropriately and instead targeted <em class="nn">her</em>, and she began a <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/gabrielle-horne-lawsuit-award-1.3641444" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">14-year legal battle that ultimately won her $1.4 million for damages to her career and reputation</a>, though <a class="ag no" href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4051304/appeal-court-reduces-cardiologists/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">a later appeal reduced this to $800,000</a>. Shockingly, <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/gabrielle-horne-disciplinary-suit-research-capital-health-1.6190659" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">the government spent $1 million on legal fees in this case</a>. Wouldn’t it have been better to just handle the bullying properly from the beginning, before the 7-figure expenses and PR disaster? <a class="ag no" href="https://www.halifaxexaminer.ca/government/province-house/the-horne-case-mumble-mouthed-nothings-from-mealy-mouthed-nobodies/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Even after winning her case, she never received an apology</a>.</p><p id="65a2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">She was not alone. A public inquiry took place into the mistreatment of <a class="ag no" href="https://www.caut.ca/docs/default-source/academic-freedom/final---independent-committee-of-inquiry--cdha-and-dalhousie-(2016-01).pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Dr. Horne as well as Dr. Michael Goodyear and Dr. Bassam A. Nassar</a>, all three of which did research for Dalhousie University while working for the Nova Scotia Health Authority. The report found that all three doctors were mistreated by both the Nova Scotia Health Authority and Dalhousie University. Their cases took several years until all were exonerated. <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/doctors-discipline-dalhousie-university-capital-health-hospitals-1.3403415" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Dr. Goodyear had to declare bankruptcy</a> due to being banned from his work as an oncologist, however he received a settlement from the health authority with a confidentiality clause that prevented him from discussing the details. Despite that report containing a recommendation for providing justice and closure to all 3 physicians, Dr. Horne’s <a class="ag no" href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-physician-heal-thyself-the-potential-crisis-of-conscience-in/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">striking article in The Globe &amp; Mail</a> indicates that she still has never received an apology from those who persecuted her.</p><p id="8793" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">In my case, I arrived in Nova Scotia fragile from surviving a life-threatening car accident on my road trip from BC to NS just 2 weeks prior to my first day of residency. It was a very delicate period in which I needed kindness, community, support, and adequate psychiatric care, but I received none of that. To complicate matters, I was born with a particular disability that I have worked very hard to hide my entire life. After the trauma of the car accident and with the difficult adjustment of relocating across the country for residency, signs of my lifelong, concealed disability began to show. Unfortunately, ableism is a significant issue at Dalhousie University. As such, within the first year of my training, I was targeted by <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/mean-girls-medicine-what-happens-when-women-bully-women-2026a100008d">1 primary bully in my initial cohort</a>: <strong class="mr hc">Dr. Katie Lines</strong>, who is significant at the start of my human rights complaint. The rest of that cohort isn’t innocent, as 3 more of them behaved in despicable ways toward me. In retrospect and after reading relevant research, it’s clear that they did not like me because of features of my hidden disability that began to surface. The impact of their bullying was severe enough that, by the end of my first year of psychiatry training and in the wake of the suicide of my supervisor <a class="ag no" href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/brother-saint-john-psychiatrist-mourns-224829429.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Dr. Louise Klipin</a>, I became clinically depressed for the first time in my life and took my first ever medical leave, primarily to try to escape those bullies.</p><p id="7d2f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">That was apparently not enough for them, as they continued to give me a hard time <em class="nn">even when I was on medical leave</em> and any time I made efforts to return to training with a fresh start. They made various dishonest and misleading claims about me in bad faith; administrative violence. Although I informed Dalhousie of the bullying primarily by Dr. Lines, they did not do anything to help me and instead entertained Dr. Lines’ DARVO. I had spoken to the Dalhousie Human Rights office early on, which severely angered Dr. Lines and she told me so in nasty texts — before retaliating against me with serious lies including slandering me to our postgraduate dean, apparently in a vindictive effort to sabotage my career due to her personal vendetta. This is <strong class="mr hc">behaviour unbecoming of a physician</strong>, yet she faced no consequences. I raised concerns about this retaliation, but Dalhousie would not take action against her; after all, she is the born &amp; raised Nova Scotian, while I am the outsider always being ostracized. Even when I received written evidence of Dr. Lines’ academic misconduct, including cheating on a significant exam, nobody took action. Instead, Dalhousie made both Dr. Lines and myself go through a flimsy mediation that was in no way restorative or healing, with no remorse or reconciliation required, and we both had to sign a non-disclosure agreement that expired when Dr. Lines graduated in the Class of 2023.</p><p id="8390" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">Yes, I was forced to sign an NDA instead of Dalhousie helping me when I was being bullied. And yes, Dr. Lines and her associate bullies are now practicing psychiatrists, possibly bullying other vulnerable trainees now. Despite Dr. Lines’ bullying tendencies extending to her making one of my patients cry <em class="nn">on Christmas</em> during Dr. Lines’ final year of training, and despite their history of bullying a disabled colleague, the Dal Psych Class of 2023 now has unsupervised access to many vulnerable, disabled patients. Meanwhile, <a class="ag no" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240220005224/https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/faculty/medicine/departments/core-units/student-affairs/Dr%20Katie%20Lines%20DMNS%20Career%20Advisor%20DMNS.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Dr. Lines’ Dalhousie bio online</a> indicates that she appreciates only the EA in EDIA, indicating that, to this day, she does not appreciate diversity nor inclusion, which is fitting as she has still never shown an ounce of remorse to me for bullying and excluding me — the ‘different’, disabled colleague. Toward the end of Dr. Lines’ training, someone told me they believe she has “grown”, and apparently at some point she was touting some redemption narrative <em class="nn">to other people</em>, implying she had learned from how much pain she caused me. I did not consent to be part of her fabricated personal growth story, which I assume was created for her failed efforts to obtain a geriatric psychiatry fellowship and convey a better character to the program director who knew what she did to me. She never demonstrated any kind of humility and grace <em class="nn">to me</em>, so I fear she is incapable of <em class="nn">genuine</em> empathy and remorse.</p><p id="e379" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">I finally found a good trauma therapist a few years later, and I have since had <strong class="mr hc">hours upon hours</strong> of EMDR trauma therapy because of Dr. Lines, partially because she lacks the honour, dignity, and integrity to take accountability for her petty and vicious actions that destroyed my Dalhousie experience, and I have never had closure. She instead always managed to turn her abuses of me into, “Yeah but, she called me out, so she’s the problem!” It’s an ongoing pattern in Nova Scotia; every time I stood up for myself, the perpetrators made clear that<em class="nn"> I did something bad</em> by being outspoken instead of “keeping my head down”, which a former Dalhousie Psychiatry program director recommended that I do when I told him I was being bullied. That is Dalhousie Psychiatry's approach to bullying: tell the victim to "keep your head down". My persecutors successfully branded me as the Wicked Witch of the West any time I stood up for what’s right. I worry for Dr. Lines’ patients and for any medical students with different abilities, whose careers she could hamper with her approach. Her refusal to ever apologize to me for destroying my Dalhousie experience is a reflection of her character; had she ever apologized, I would not have mentioned her now. I’m not alone in my qualms with Dr. Lines; other colleagues have mentioned to me that she made discriminatory, unprofessional, and condescending comments to them that made them want to leave NS after training too. I see Dalhousie’s inaction towards this bully as a failure of the institution, their bias forming the early part of my human rights complaint.</p><p id="cfc5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">Alas, bullying in medical culture at Dalhousie seems to be a recurring theme. The <a class="ag no" href="https://globalnews.ca/news/2010585/dalhousie-dentistry-students-break-silence-on-gentlemens-club-facebook-scandal/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Dalhousie Dentistry Gentleman’s Club scandal</a> went viral in 2015. This involved a Facebook group in which male students of the dentistry school were writing misogynistic and homophobic comments about female classmates and women in general, while promoting rape culture. There were unproven allegations that the men involved were a part of a secret rape club, given that some of the comments in the Facebook group included men sharing a desire to chloroform and rape attractive colleagues. <a class="ag no" href="https://globalnews.ca/news/1755191/restorative-justice-will-it-work-in-the-dalhousie-facebook-scandal/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">All 13 dentistry students involved in the group were suspended.</a> A restorative justice process was initiated, which the female dentistry students shared they felt they were being forced into, as they expressed <a class="ag no" href="https://globalnews.ca/news/1759509/female-dentistry-students-feel-forced-into-dalhousies-restorative-justice-process/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">feeling silenced, isolated, and discouraged from proceeding formally</a>. Despite these concerns, the restorative justice process proceeded, concluded, and <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/12-of-13-dalhousie-dentistry-students-involved-in-scandal-graduate-1.3093731" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">12 of the 13 men involved in the Gentlemen’s Club group graduated</a>.

This includes one male psychiatrist, who <strong class="mr hc">I will not name at this time due to the sensitivity of the ongoing legal action against him for what he did to me</strong>. Nonetheless, I will say that he caused me severe psychological trauma with his actions. The situation essentially amounts to a powerful man, rejected by a pretty woman with less power, making efforts to discredit her and destroy her career in retaliation for the rejection; a tale as old as time, at least since the #MeToo era. Our regulatory body, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia, heavily disappointed me when they chose to give him a slap on the wrist for his actions. After a 2-year investigation, they simply gave him a formal Caution on his internal record for his sexualized behaviour towards me, and made him do some professionalism training. No real consequences for a pervert preying on a younger medical trainee. I am still waiting to see if CMPA has the integrity to settle out of court in my lawsuit against him, instead of continuing to protect a predator. Nonetheless, his actions have turned Nova Scotia into an extremely unsafe place for me to train and work in psychiatry.</p><p id="f182" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">The NS health authority claimed to be committed to creating a <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/whitecoat/why-doctors-face-an-uphill-battle-when-fighting-against-workplace-harassment-and-bullying-1.5118954" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">“safe and harassment-free work environment”</a> and initiated a respectful workplace policy in 2017. Despite the lengthy legal case of Dr. Horne, and the recommendations from the public inquiry to improve the culture within the health authority, <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/health-cardiac-surgery-harassment-discrimination-halifax-1.6480564" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">further allegations of a toxic workplace later made headlines in 2022</a>. Unfortunately, some physicians hoping to make Halifax their permanent home have also faced <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nsh-cardiac-surgery-dalhousie-university-doctors-health-1.6476938" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">“racism, discrimination, double standards, disrespect and division”</a> within the system, such as Dr. Mohammed Al-Mansob. He described receiving fewer opportunities in the workplace, being held to different standards, “facing accusations of bad behaviour without evidence, and a lack of action from leadership”. He ended up leaving the province to continue his fellowship training in Toronto. Dr. Mohamed Othman reported similar experiences of toxicity, stating, “It was like a circus.” Dr. Ahmed Al Lawati further described passive-aggressiveness and microaggressions in the workplace, and pointed out that those persecuting him were smart enough to never abuse him in front of other people. He was placed on academic probation after he was frequently forced to be evaluated by the same people who were targeting him. He started to look at alternative options and moved to Hamilton, Ontario. In response to these three claims of systematic racism, Dalhousie University’s medical school <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nsh-cardiac-surgery-dalhousie-university-doctors-health-1.6476938" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">declined to be interviewed by CBC</a> and instead sent a statement claiming to take all incidents of mistreatment very seriously. The health authority later claimed the problems were fixed, while also <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cardiac-surgery-halifax-doctor-gail-darling-dalhousie-1.6855490" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">shutting down their cardiac surgery fellowship program</a>.</p><p id="48b9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">Similarly, I experienced substantial mistreatment by <strong class="mr hc">Dr. Donna Davis</strong>, a supervisor for my inpatient psychiatry rotation. I attempted to advocate for myself throughout my rotation, which she shut down irritably every time, leading to substantial tension between us. I reached out to my program director, who refused to intervene and later denied that I even mentioned any problems to him at all, even though the proof is in writing. In my final evaluation, Dr. D. Davis used elements of my disability against me and wrote many inappropriate remarks about me that were evidently more personal than professional, which also forms part of the basis for my human rights complaint. Other residents who had problems with her told me they wouldn’t even bother writing her a bad evaluation because they had no hope that anything would change, and feared that they would instead face retaliation. That’s how trainee mistreatment continues for years and years; everyone is too scared or demoralized to speak up, so the administration doesn’t believe the few of us who do, and I found the Dal Psych program to be unbelievably unsupportive and biased.</p><p id="2fde" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">In January 2023, Dalhousie announced that they had launched a new <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/dalhousie-medical-school-mistreatment-harassment-bullying-1.6712113" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Office of Professional Affairs to manage complaints of mistreatment</a>. The new office was in development for over 2 years after a report by the university’s senate review committee revealed that numerous (1 in 5) medical trainees had faced harassment, discrimination, and bullying in their learning and working environment. Later in 2023, a newly <a class="ag no" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0142159X.2023.2279903" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">published peer-reviewed research article</a> found that <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/medical-resident-mistreatment-study-dalhousie-1.7058488" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">“mistreatment of medical residents in the Maritimes remains common and underreported”</a>. Residents who had experienced mistreatment pointed out that the medical hierarchy enables mistreatment, and that many don’t report incidents of mistreatment because of fears of retaliation. Problems with harassment within medical culture at Dalhousie University continue to the present day, as the university announced in June 2024 that they had pulled all medical students and post-graduate residency trainees from any cardiac training at some New Brunswick sites of the university. The reasons given were again <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/dalhousie-university-medical-students-harassment-training-saint-john-cardiac-heart-centre-1.7219619" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">behaviours related to intimidation, harassment, and discrimination</a>.</p><p id="b804" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">The Nova Scotia Health Authority has also been subject to <a class="ag no" href="https://globalnews.ca/news/3604839/substantial-privacy-breach-sees-hundreds-of-n-s-patient-records-accessed/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">multiple privacy breaches over several years</a>, where <a class="ag no" href="https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/patients-involved-in-n-s-mass-shooting-among-those-caught-up-in-major-privacy-breach-1.6265215" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">multiple employees accessed the records of hundreds of patients whose care they were not involved in</a>, <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-health-privacy-breaches-200-people-1.5673578" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">such as family or colleagues</a>, revealing a <a class="ag no" href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/officials-caught-snooping-on-health-records-n-s-privacy-commissioner-says-1.4177121" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">“dangerous and insidious culture of entitlement”</a> to <a class="ag no" href="https://www.halifaxexaminer.ca/government/province-house/an-employee-at-a-dartmouth-orthopaedic-clinic-snooped-through-2500-patients-records-but-wont-be-charged-with-privacy-violations/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">unauthorized viewing of private patient records</a> and leading to a million-dollar class action lawsuit that the authority paid out in 2017. The lawyers involved with a subsequent 2024 proposed class action lawsuit allege that <a class="ag no" href="https://www.halifaxexaminer.ca/health/proposed-class-action-lawsuit-filed-against-nova-scotia-health-alleging-negligence-in-privacy-breach/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">the health authority is negligent in preventing serial privacy breaches</a>. I have also been the target of a privacy breach by a fellow resident doctor in Nova Scotia who had no business looking through my private medical records, which was a confirmed breach after an investigation. Having a man curiously peer into the details of my body without my consent feels like a cognitive form of sexual assault and it is traumatic enough that I avoided publicly funded healthcare in NS after that. To make matters worse, he did actually sexually assault me as well, around the same time that he illegally looked into my medical records. While the police were eager to charge him, they informed me that they could not do so with my identity protected. The rationale is that I had no reason to fear for my safety, as we are living in difference provinces thousands of kilometres away from each other. Given how the public treats victims of sexual assault, I chose not to have him charged as I could not do it with my identity protected. I am dismayed that this broken system allows sexual predators to get away with it because the system refuses to adequately protect the victims. As of December 2025, our medical regulatory body, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, is still determining what action to take against him, but I expect they will again just give him a slap on the wrists, much like Dalhousie University, who did nothing when I asked them to take action against a former student who clearly lacks the ethical values required to be in the trusted position of a physician. That is consistent with their tendency to do nothing whenever someone has harmed me. Plus, I can no longer count on one hand how many times physicians employed by Dalhousie University breached my confidentiality, allegedly by "accident". How many accidents does it take before we acknowledge that there's something more going on?</p><p id="21a4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">Clearly, these situations are not one-off issues. This laundry list of scandals indicates a widespread, pervasive cultural problem within the medical areas of Nova Scotia, marked by envy, jealousy, hatred toward anyone successful, discrimination, entitlement, and a narcissistic drive to destroy anyone who is perceived as some form of a threat. This is probably not an exclusively Nova Scotian problem, as <a class="ag no" href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/196/9/E295" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">medical culture in general has problems that we need to all work together to eradicate within medical fields everywhere</a>. Yet, I have traveled all over Canada and all over the world, and I have never seen a first-world culture so bitter, hateful, and retaliatory as what I’ve seen in Nova Scotia in general, even within the population outside of medicine.</p><p id="73e9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">I have also met some truly wonderful Nova Scotians and I am very grateful they exist to balance out the bad apples. The good ones are so special, so rare, and so needed, because those <strong class="mr hc">bad apples are significant</strong>. Consider the actions of <strong class="mr hc">Dr. Deborah Parker</strong>, the psychiatry program’s former program director. As I mentioned earlier, I experienced a predatory psychiatrist targeting me out of retaliation for rejection in a way that caused me severe psychological trauma. The trauma of that man’s actions affected me substantially for all of 2022 and for years after that. When Dr. Parker became program director that summer 2022, instead of understanding the horrific experience I had gone through, she became quite biased against me thanks to that predator and the snowball effect he initiated to destroy my mental health. She hurt me — a lot — with her actions being another driving force behind my human rights complaint. As a result of my destroyed mental health thanks to the predator, bullies, and an unsupportive program, I went on an extended trauma-related medical leave from Dalhousie from 2023, because it is now abundantly clear that Nova Scotia has been made an irredeemably unsafe place for me.</p><p id="e76f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">Thankfully, in Dr. Parker’s case, we did finally see some justice. It turns out she has a tendency to split the residents into “good and bad” — only the women, though. She engaged in numerous despicable and discriminatory actions, including offensive remarks to multiple trainees, demonstrating her ableism and her vilification of any women that somehow trigger her. In this case, a large group of people were brave enough to actually speak up instead of the usual quiet grumbles with no action. After an investigation, Dr. Parker was required to undergo professionalism remediation in summer 2024, but instead stepped down from her position as program director on July 30, 2024, a day that was celebrated by many of the female trainees she hurt. I can’t believe I once tried to reason with her, tried to reconcile with her, when she proved as unreasonable and cruel as Dolores Umbridge.</p><p id="744b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">I am concerned, though, that she is apparently still a member of the Competence Committee and Residency Program Committee. In my opinion, she has demonstrated that she is unfit to be in a position of making any decisions about medical trainees, and I feel that people with such aggressively negative attitudes toward residents should not be allowed anywhere near trainees. I recall when she was teaching our class of psychiatry trainees and she casually referred to a patient — her patients are mostly people with severe trauma — as a “bitch”. Even in online reviews, her patients express dissatisfaction, and apparently Dr. Parker has stated that she doesn’t care about the “loony” patients who write reviews online. Speaking of vulnerable patients in this horrendous way, using derogatory language instead of either <em class="nn">learning from negative feedback</em> or <em class="nn">compassionately interpreting tense interpersonal dynamics as a feature of the heterogeneity of patient trauma responses</em>, is <strong class="mr hc">conduct unbecoming of a physician</strong>. Who feels comfortable knowing their psychiatrist called them a “bitch”, “loony”, or anything else along those lines behind their back while training the next generation of doctors? It is a failure of Dalhousie University to allow her to maintain any ongoing authority within the residency program, and I worry for both her patients and any trainees who she may continue to hurt. Sadly, it’s <em class="nn">very common</em> for many psychiatrists at Dalhousie to make derogatory comments about patients — every time I expressed my discomfort at hearing these unprofessional remarks, my concerns were dismissed.</p><p id="de81" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">Unfortunately, these problems are cemented in the fact that Nova Scotians are generally not receptive to feedback. I’ve frequently seen that any criticism is met with defensiveness, as locals try to rationalize their decision to live in this province by logicking that the complainant must be the problem because surely, Nova Scotia can’t be that bad. It triggers too much cognitive dissonance to believe that the place one has tolerated one’s whole life is, yes, actually <em class="nn">that</em> bad! Cognitive defenses lead people to scapegoat the victim of mistreatment, the Wicked Witch of the West, in order to justify the decision to continue supporting problematic systems, which means little changes and the problems are reinforced.</p><p id="066e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">People in Nova Scotia lament their lack of physicians and consequently strained healthcare system. Yet when good doctors go to the province, they can face such severe mistreatment that they eventually wish to leave. Those who stay are largely those who were born and raised in the area and may not know how much better it is elsewhere, or those who have put down roots such as through finding love locally, or those who know how to manipulate the toxic culture to their advantage and find that they can wield excess power there, while they would not be nearly so successful playing the role of a villain anywhere else.</p><p id="d41d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">“Come-from-away” might be a cute musical about Newfoundland, but when this term is used to describe someone new to Nova Scotia, it is frankly offensive. It connotes “you are an outsider and I see it”. I have faced this term and this attitude many times since trying to assimilate, and I gave up trying to “join the family” of Nova Scotia a long time ago. I am an outsider there, I accept this, and that is why I left. “Nicest people in Canada”, you say? I guarantee you, there are nicer people in Canada.</p><p id="d994" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk"><strong class="mr hc">And that is why this “come-from-away” finally went away.</strong> I left and returned to the home province where I have always been celebrated and supported, where anyone who tried to pick on me was quickly and appropriately redirected, where the words "justice" and "human rights" actually have some meaning. I returned home, because the way I was treated by Dalhousie University and the cold-hearted psychiatrists of Nova Scotia put me dangerously close to death by suicide. I returned home, because there are too many monsters in NS, and I continue to have PTSD that developed because of them. I returned home, because every time I step foot in the province of NS, my protector part takes over and I am unable to be my true self due to the deep lack of safety. I returned home, because you cannot effectively cure trauma that is ongoing, and <strong class="mr hc">the province of Nova Scotia is itself one of my most traumatic experiences. </strong><p>I suspect Dalhousie would like to see me die quietly, given their approach to me that indicates my life and my rights are insignificant to them. As someone told me, “Not all universities are student-centered. Dal definitely isn’t.” In a province that ranks the worst economy in North America, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251110132040/https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/dept/financial-services/Reports/Annual%20Reports/2024-25%20Annual%20Financial%20Report%20Final%20(003)%20(002).pdf">Dalhousie University has a revenue of approximately $1 billion per year</a>. Yet when it comes to caring about students enough to <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/atlantic/nova-scotia/article/dalhousie-university-says-it-wont-offer-tuition-refunds-following-month-long-lockout/">return what was taken from them, the answer is no</a>. This is not an institution that demonstrates concern for its students, nor for the time taken from them or the opportunity costs imposed on their lives.</p><figure class="nq nr ns nt nu gw gs gt paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="nv nw fi nx bh ny"><div class="gs gt np"><picture><source srcSet="https://dalhumanrightsabuse.github.io/DalhousieReputation.png 640w, https://dalhumanrightsabuse.github.io/DalhousieReputation.png 720w, https://dalhumanrightsabuse.github.io/DalhousieReputation.png 750w, https://dalhumanrightsabuse.github.io/DalhousieReputation.png 786w, https://dalhumanrightsabuse.github.io/DalhousieReputation.png 828w, https://dalhumanrightsabuse.github.io/DalhousieReputation.png 1100w, https://dalhumanrightsabuse.github.io/DalhousieReputation.png 1400w" sizes="(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" type="image/webp"/><source data-testid="og" srcSet="https://dalhumanrightsabuse.github.io/DalhousieReputation.png 640w, https://dalhumanrightsabuse.github.io/DalhousieReputation.png 720w, https://dalhumanrightsabuse.github.io/DalhousieReputation.png 750w, https://dalhumanrightsabuse.github.io/DalhousieReputation.png 786w, https://dalhumanrightsabuse.github.io/DalhousieReputation.png 828w, https://dalhumanrightsabuse.github.io/DalhousieReputation.png 1100w, https://dalhumanrightsabuse.github.io/DalhousieReputation.png 1400w" sizes="(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"/><img alt="" class="bh gx gy c" width="700" height="607" loading="lazy" role="presentation"/></picture></div></div></figure><p id="751e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mp mq hb mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm gn bk">I don’t know how Nova Scotia is going to resolve these longstanding, entrenched problems of <a class="ag no" href="https://thewalrus.ca/toxic-work/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">toxic workplace issues</a>. Multiple healthcare providers who have trained or worked in the region have left due to the province's pervasive culture of discrimination, bullying, and harassment. Though I had to leave that province to recover my sanity, my prayers remain with those left behind that the Nova Scotian dystopia can somehow, eventually, be changed, for the sake of the many good people who truly deserve better, while realistically knowing nothing will truly change. For anyone considering a move to Nova Scotia, be very careful. I would give anything to take back ever interviewing at Dalhousie, ever believing the lies of an institution that already had a terrible reputation for bullying, ever naively trusting they could do better. No, I believe this is a narcissistic institution incapable of the level of accountability required for authentic change. The full story of everything that happened to me - in complete detail - is long enough that it required writing a novel. That memoir will be published one day, under my pen name, with the publication date to be pushed back repeatedly until the timing is right from a legal standpoint. Until then, all I know is that <strong class="mr hc">moving to Nova Scotia was the biggest mistake of my life, and it almost caused my death. </strong>It still could — Nova Scotia’s psychiatrists want to silence me, through career sabotage rather than through the maturity of reconciliation. But my book will be published posthumously if it comes to it, because even in death, I refuse to be silenced.</p></div>
